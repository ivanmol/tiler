# Tiler bash script

----

**This repo is incomplete.** I can't get the tiler script to work, however, the stitcher works fine, although it's a bit clunky and still needs work.

----

## Requirements

* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php)

## Running

```bash
./stitch.sh <*arguments*>
``` 

## Usage
```bash

		   for files following convention: map_1_50000_2_14.png
```
